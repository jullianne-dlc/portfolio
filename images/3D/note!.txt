remember to change <div class="game-row-a"> to like b, c, d, e I think, I made other variations for when there are less than 3 images in a row. Right now each row has three but before the bottom row had two and I was using <div class="game-row-e"> for it, 'cause it spaces two images evenly in the center with bruteforced margin space around it. Just don't forget in case you needa change things later!
