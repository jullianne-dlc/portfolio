to do list::

-- actual header logo
-- ohhhh wait you should make sprites of all the characterssss, they can hang out at the top logo area. then when you hover over them, make them do things. and when you click on them have them take you to their respective project page :D
-- also figure out what menu categories to use

digital traditional
illustration / animation / 3D / life drawing / games

DONE-- functional navbar (text titles, clickable, stylized, etc)

-- fix making everything fade in (re-do it so it doesn't rely on being an image to fade in)

WIP-- images/descriptions of all projects :0


(4/25)
DONE-- make the menu buttons turn in to a single collapsible menu button (turns into a drop-down when you click on it) when the screen size is mobile (640px wide).

(4/26)
-- make the text inside the images wrap sooner (sometimes the text touches really close to the edge of the image, doesn't loook super clean)

(4/28)
-- go back and make all of the images a minimum of 640 width. the biggest they should display is 640 for mobile, and just having that consistency is always good.

(4/29)
-- figure out why the link hitbox for the logo at the top is so big wehh. not a big deal but it bothers me a little.



(8/7)
NAH?-- Like Me: short/small gifs of actions in the game? (opening camera taking photo, reading messages, you're so pretty screen, crying and cracking screen) record on phone and convert to gif in that one app?

(8/8)
DONE-- needa recreate the menu screen loop for Little Shrimp the way I did for Masterpiece Project today! 
-- put together early concepts for things like masterpiece and shrimpo :000 all of them basically lol

(8/10)
-- edit/touch up the new Yobby photos. alternate different grids (a,b,c,d) to make the images flow nicely.

(8/11)
-- damn, okay towards the end go back and make sure all your images are small :'0 I'm worried my site's gonna be hella slow when I host it on github bc my images are huge lol. Try to get most pictures to KB's. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY! Edit the values for grids a/b/c/d. changing the image sizes WILL break how the images act when the screen resizes. Have a consistent system okay? This whole thing will probs take a long time weh, goodluck iannnnnn
